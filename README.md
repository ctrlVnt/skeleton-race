# Skeleton Race

Welcome to my first game, built with [Godot](https://godotengine.org/)

It's a casual survival arcade experience, inspired by games like Last War, but without the village management. Perfect for a quick, relaxing break-ideal for a 'toilet game' session! ðŸ˜‰

## How to test

* Download [Godot](https://godotengine.org/)
* Clone this rÃ©pository
* Import project and select cloned folder
* Enjoy !
